# Neocities Aesthetic Redesign Notes

## What Changed

Completely revamped from the original "clean corporate" design to authentic Neocities vibes.

### Design Philosophy

**Before:** Clean, modern, professional Pinterest aesthetic
**After:** Chaotic, homegrown, early 2000s web nostalgia

### Key Changes

1. **Typography**
   - Replaced Playfair Display & Poppins with Comic Sans, Fredoka, Caveat
   - More playful, less formal fonts
   - Hand-written style for main question

2. **Color Scheme**
   - Brighter, more saturated colors
   - Less "professional" pastels, more vibrant pinks
   - Rainbow text effects
   - Neon-ish borders

3. **Layout**
   - Less structured, more scattered
   - Marquee tags (classic!)
   - Visitor counter (nostalgic touch)
   - Doodle-style borders
   - Rotated elements for that hand-made feel

4. **Language & Tone**
   - Changed from formal to super casual
   - Lowercase everything
   - "lol", "fr", "ngl", "u" instead of "you"
   - More personality, less corporate
   - Example: "Will you be my Valentine?" → "will you be my valentine??"
   - Example: "You made my day!" → "OMG YOU SAID YES!!!"

5. **Animations**
   - More chaotic: wobbles, bounces, spins
   - Less smooth/polished transitions
   - More "homemade" feel
   - Sparkles, blinks, rainbow effects

6. **Interactive Elements**
   - Same functionality but more playful
   - Button text: "YES!!" instead of "Yes! 💕"
   - Encourage text: "👀 psst... the no button is kinda sus"
   - Easter eggs (rapid clicking detection)

7. **Visual Elements**
   - Removed Tailwind CSS (too clean)
   - Hand-coded everything for authenticity
   - Doodle borders with stars
   - Scattered decorative emojis
   - Custom cursor (heart emoji)
   - Pixelated visitor counter

## What Stayed the Same

- Core functionality (dodgy no button)
- Confetti celebration
- Music toggle
- Mobile responsiveness
- All interactive behaviors
- Structure (just different styling)

## Aesthetic References

- Classic Neocities sites
- Early 2000s MySpace/GeoCities
- Webcore/Y2K aesthetics
- Personal homepages
- Less "designed", more "made with love"

## Technical Details

- Pure CSS (no Tailwind)
- Custom animations
- Comic Sans unironically
- Marquee tags (they're back baby!)
- HTML emojis everywhere
- Casual console.logs

## The Vibe

**Corporate:** "A romantic proposal experience"
**Neocities:** "yo will u be my valentine lol"

It's authentic, personal, chaotic, fun, and most importantly - NOT trying to be perfect.
That's what makes it special.
