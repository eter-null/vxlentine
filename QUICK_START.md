# 💖 quick start guide 💖

## what u got here

a chaotic valentine proposal website with neocities vibes!! its got:
- dodgy no button that literally runs away
- confetti explosions
- marquee tags (iconic)
- rainbow text
- visitor counter
- pure chaos (in a good way)

## how to use it

### 1. test it locally

just open `index.html` in ur browser! double click it or drag it into chrome/firefox/whatever

### 2. add ur own music (optional)

1. find a romantic song u like
2. convert it to mp3 (keep it under 3mb)
3. put it in `assets/music/` and name it `background.mp3`
4. boom! music activated

### 3. customize the message

edit `index.html` and find the success message section (around line 100+)
change the text to whatever u wanna say!! keep it real and personal

### 4. deploy to github pages

```bash
# create a new repo on github called "vxlentine" or whatever

# then run these commands:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vxlentine.git
git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main

# go to repo settings > pages
# set source to "main" branch
# wait like 2 min
# ur site is live at: YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/vxlentine
```

### 5. share it!!

send the link to nazia and hope for the best!! 🤞💕

## tips

- test on ur phone too!! (should work fine but always check)
- if music doesnt play, the browser might block it - just tell them to click the music button
- the no button gets harder to click each time (thats the point lol)
- after like 8 dodges it just gives up and becomes a yes button

## troubleshooting

**no button not moving?**
- make sure javascript is enabled
- try a different browser

**gifs not loading?**
- need internet connection (theyre from giphy)
- if u want, download them and put in assets/gifs/

**looks weird on mobile?**
- should work fine! but test it urself
- worst case zoom out a bit

**someone found a bug?**
- edit the files and push again
- git will auto-update the site

## customizing

want different colors? edit `style.css`
want different text? edit `index.html`  
want different button behavior? edit `script.js`

its all there! mess around with it!

**good luck with ur proposal!! 💕**
